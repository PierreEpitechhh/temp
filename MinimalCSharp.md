*Note, this is for .NET Framework! Nowadays you probably want to use `dotnet new` cli to make a dotnet core project.*

If you've ever started a simple C# project in Visual Studio, it creates a lot of cruft in your project.

These are a minimal set of files that you can start writing a C# programs. I deleted most lines from a starter CSPROJ and SLN file to get this starter template.

These files open and build cleanly in:
* msbuild
* Visual Studio
* Visual Studio Code
* mono (xbuild)


Feel free to download these files and do whatever you want.
